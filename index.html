        <p id="pOne">The baby Shower was a totaly new experience.<br/>
                      My family and freinds were all invited. My wifes Family is out of state so <br/>
                      most of the gifts just started appearing at our door step. I never would have <br/>
                      thought that babys require so much stuff. From what I hear the amout of stuff will <br/>
                      keep increasing. It really does take a villiage. </p>

        <p id="pTwo">Picking a name is much harder that I thought. <br/>
                     There are so many factors that a parent must thing about. Will <br/>
                     the intials spell something weird like P.I.G. Patrick Irvin Goldman? Does it <br/>
                     sound right when you yell "Star Moonlight Rogers put that down!"? Will <br/>
                     kids on the playground make fun of the name? The new one is concidering an <br/>
                     future email name. Most companies will require an email address of first inital <br/>
                     lastname@business.com. Frank Akins is now FAtkins@business.com.</p>

        <p id="pThree">The baby will be here soon, where had the time gone?<br/>
                       My wife tells me the other day that the due date is only <br/>
                       six weeks away, in a clam voice. HOLY SMOKES, I go into new parent freak out <br/>
                       mode. Do we have the go bag packed? Is there gas in both cars? Do we have everything for <br/>
                       the baby set up? Do I even know how to burp a baby? I am one of those type "A" planning<br/>
                       type of people, and this is not something that goes to plan. Although, I am sure that<br/>
                       it will all work out fine......... Just as long as I can prep like crazy for it. :)</p>
